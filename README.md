Create a form that calculates the change when the user enters a sum
and price of goods. Requirements for the form:
● Sum entry field
Here the user enters the amount of money he/she gives.
● Price entry field
Here the user enters the price for goods he/she purchases.
● Return the rest action button
When pressed, the script calculates what is the change for 1 cent,
5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, and dollars. For example,
when user enters 3.14 dollars as “Sum” and 0.99 dollars as “Price”,
the script should give a response “Your rest is 2 dollars, 15 cents”
(by nominal value of 2 dollars, 10 cents, 5 cents)
